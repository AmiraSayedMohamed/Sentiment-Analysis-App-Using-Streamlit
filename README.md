# Sentiment Analysis Web App 🚀

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Web App**! 🌟 This project uses Machine Learning to analyze the sentiment of any text input, providing real-time feedback to the user. The app not only tells you if a sentiment is positive or negative, but it also brings emotional effects 🎈 (balloons for positivity 🎉 and trees 🌲 for negativity) to enhance the experience! 🎭

## 📜 Features

- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Input a review or text, and the app will predict if the sentiment is positive or negative. 💬
- **Visual Effects**: When the sentiment is positive, balloons 🎈 move upwards! When it's negative, sad trees 🌳 move downwards! 🌧️
- **Emotionally Enhanced**: Enjoy a dynamic and interactive user experience with cheerful and sad animations. 🥳😭
- **Interactive Design**: The app provides a smooth and visually engaging interface, with text results appearing dynamically after the prediction button is clicked. 💻

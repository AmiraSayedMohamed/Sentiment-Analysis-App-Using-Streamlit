# Sentiment Analysis Web App 🚀

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Web App**! 🌟 This project uses Machine Learning to analyze the sentiment of any text input, providing real-time feedback to the user. The app not only tells you if a sentiment is positive or negative, but it also brings emotional effects 🎈 (balloons for positivity 🎉 and trees 🌲 for negativity) to enhance the experience! 🎭

## 📜 Features

- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Input a review or text, and the app will predict if the sentiment is positive or negative. 💬
- **Visual Effects**: When the sentiment is positive, balloons 🎈 move upwards! When it's negative, sad trees 🌳 move downwards! 🌧️
- **Emotionally Enhanced**: Enjoy a dynamic and interactive user experience with cheerful and sad animations. 🥳😭
- **Interactive Design**: The app provides a smooth and visually engaging interface, with text results appearing dynamically after the prediction button is clicked. 💻

Now you can access the app at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser! 🌐

## 🎯 How to Use
- Enter any text or review in the text input box. 📝
- Press the "Predict" button to get the sentiment analysis results! 🟢🔴
- Watch the emotional effects unfold based on the sentiment:
  - Balloons 🎈 will appear when the sentiment is positive 🥳.
  - Sad trees 🌳 will move when the sentiment is negative 😔.
